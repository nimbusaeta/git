discovery.bare::
	Specifies whether Git will work with a bare repository that
	wasn't specified via the top-level `--git-dir` command-line
	option, or the `GIT_DIR` environment variable (see
	linkgit:git[1]). If the repository is specified, Git will always
	use the specified repository, regardless of this value.
+
This config setting is only respected in protected configuration (see
<<SCOPES>>). This prevents the untrusted repository from tampering with
this value.
+
The currently supported values are:
+
* `always`: Git always works with bare repositories
* `never`: Git never works with bare repositories
+
If you do not use bare repositories in your workflow, then it may be
beneficial to set `discovery.bare` to `never` in your global config.
This will protect you from attacks that involve cloning a repository
that contains a bare repository and running a Git command within that
directory.
